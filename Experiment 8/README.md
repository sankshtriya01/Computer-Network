# Experiment 8: IPv4, IPv6 and Address Mapping Simulation

## 1. Objective
The objective of this assignment is to simulate logical addressing using IPv4 and IPv6 and demonstrate address mapping techniques such as ARP, RARP, BOOTP, and DHCP. The simulation visualizes how devices acquire and resolve network addresses.

## 2. Concepts Covered
- IPv4 Addressing
- IPv6 Addressing
- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- RARP (Reverse ARP)
- BOOTP (Bootstrap Protocol)
- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)

## 3. Network Topology
The network consists of:

- 2 PCs
- 1 Server (DHCP, BOOTP, RARP)
- 1 Router
- 1 Switch

## 4. Network Configuration

### IPv4 Addressing (Static)

| Device  | IPv4 Address    |
|---------|-----------------|
| PC0     | 192.168.1.2     |
| PC1     | 192.168.1.3     |
| Router  | 192.168.1.1     |
| Server  | 192.168.1.10    |

### IPv6 Addressing

| Device  | IPv6 Address          |
|---------|-----------------------|
| PC0     | 2001:db8:1::2        |
| PC1     | 2001:db8:1::3        |
| Router  | 2001:db8:1::1        |
| Server  | 2001:db8:1::10       |

## 5. Address Mapping Techniques

### ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
**Implementation**
- Ping executed from PC0 to PC1

**Observation**
- ARP request broadcast sent
- ARP reply received with MAC address

### RARP (Reverse ARP)
**Implementation**
- RARP service enabled on server
- MAC-to-IP mappings configured

**Observation**
- Client requested IP using MAC
- Server responded with IP address

### BOOTP
**Implementation**
- BOOTP service enabled on server
- Static IP mappings configured

**Observation**
- Client requested IP
- Server assigned predefined IP

### DHCP
**Implementation**
- DHCP service enabled on server
- IP pool configured

**Observation**
- DHCP Discover
- DHCP Offer
- DHCP Request
- DHCP Acknowledgment

## 6. IPv4 and IPv6 Communication
- Successful ping using IPv4
- Successful ping using IPv6
- Verified dual-stack communication

## 7. Simulation and Visualization
Using Simulation Mode:
- Observed ARP packets
- Tracked DHCP handshake
- Monitored ICMP communication
- Analyzed packet-level details

## 8. Comparison of Techniques

| Protocol | Function          | Dynamic | Usage              |
|----------|-------------------|---------|--------------------|
| ARP      | IP → MAC          | No      | Local network      |
| RARP     | MAC → IP          | No      | Legacy             |
| BOOTP    | IP assignment     | Limited | Boot devices       |
| DHCP     | Dynamic IP        | Yes     | Modern networks    |

## 9. Observations
- ARP resolved MAC addresses successfully
- DHCP dynamically assigned IP addresses
- BOOTP assigned static predefined IPs
- RARP demonstrated reverse mapping conceptually
- IPv6 communication worked alongside IPv4

## 10. Challenges Faced
- Limited support for RARP in simulation
- Configuring multiple services on server
- Understanding packet flow in Simulation Mode

## 11. Improvements
- Add DNS integration
- Simulate larger networks
- Explore IPv6 DHCP (DHCPv6)
- Analyze network performance under load

## 12. Conclusion
The simulation successfully demonstrated logical addressing and address mapping techniques. IPv4 and IPv6 communication were verified, and protocols like ARP and DHCP played a crucial role in address resolution and allocation.
