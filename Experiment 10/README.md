# Experiment 10: DNS and DDNS Simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer


#  1. Objective

The objective of this assignment is to simulate the working of the **Domain Name System (DNS)** and **Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS)**. The simulation demonstrates how domain names are resolved to IP addresses and how DNS records can be updated dynamically in a network environment.

---

#  2. Concepts Covered

* DNS (Domain Name Resolution)
* DDNS (Dynamic DNS Updates)
* Client-Server Communication
* Name-to-IP Mapping
* Network Configuration and Testing

---

#  3. Network Topology

The network consists of:

* 1 Server (DNS + DDNS)
* 2 Client PCs
* 1 Switch

#  4. Network Configuration

##  IP Addressing

| Device | IP Address  | Subnet Mask   | DNS Server  |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Server | 192.168.1.1 | 255.255.255.0 | —           |
| PC0    | 192.168.1.2 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.1.1 |
| PC1    | 192.168.1.3 | 255.255.255.0 | 192.168.1.1 |

---

##  Cabling

* All devices are connected using **Copper Straight-Through cables**
* Communication occurs through a switch

---

#  5. DNS Configuration

* DNS service was enabled on the server
* The following DNS records were added:

| Domain Name | IP Address  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| example.com | 192.168.1.1 |
| test.com    | 192.168.1.1 |

---

#  6. DNS Query Testing

##  Using Web Browser

* Accessed `example.com` from PC0
  ✔ Result: Successfully resolved to server IP and loaded webpage

---

##  Using Command Prompt

Command used:

```
nslookup test.com
```

✔ Result: Returned correct IP address (192.168.1.1)

---

#  7. DDNS Simulation (Dynamic Updates)

Since real dynamic updates are not fully supported in Cisco Packet Tracer, DDNS was simulated manually.

---

##  Adding New Record

| Domain      | IP          |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| test.com    | 192.168.1.4 |

---

##  Updating Existing Record

| Domain      | Updated IP  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| test.com    | 192.168.1.5 |

---

#  8. Verification of Updates

##  Command Line Test

```
nslookup test.com
```

✔ Result: Updated IP address reflected successfully

---

##  Browser Test

* Accessed `example.com`
  ✔ Result: Successfully resolved and connected

#  9. Analysis

##  DNS Behaviour

* Converts human-readable domain names into IP addresses
* Enables easier network communication

---

## DDNS Behaviour

* Allows updating DNS records dynamically
* Useful in environments with frequently changing IP addresses

---

#  10. Observations

* DNS queries were resolved successfully
* Updated DNS records were reflected immediately
* Domain-based access worked correctly via browser
* System demonstrated real-world DNS behavior

---

#  11. Challenges Faced

* Incorrect DNS mapping initially caused connection errors
* Ensuring DNS service was enabled on the server
* Understanding difference between DNS resolution and HTTP access

---

#  12. Improvements / Extensions

* Integrate DNS with HTTP server for realistic browsing
* Add multiple servers and domains
* Simulate larger network environments
* Explore DNS caching behavior

---

#  13. Conclusion

The simulation successfully demonstrated the working of DNS and DDNS. DNS resolved domain names efficiently, while DDNS allowed updates to be reflected dynamically. This provides a clear understanding of how modern networks manage domain name resolution.

#  14. How to Run the Simulation

1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer
2. Verify all connections are active
3. Open PC → Command Prompt → Test using `nslookup`
4. Open Web Browser → Enter domain name
5. Observe resolution and connectivity
